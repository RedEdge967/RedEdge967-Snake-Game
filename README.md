# RedEdge967-Snake-Game

🌈Hello Everyone!!!🌈

Welcome! This is my new game called "Snake game" made using python. I made this by getting some ideas from others.
you have to eat more food to grow longer. When you touch your own, the game will restart. Enjoy!!😃😃

Note : you will need python to run this file.

<h1><i>Special notes</i></h1>
<h2><b>Snake game v1.0</b></h2>

In Snake game v1.0, you can go <i>anywhere without losing</i> but <i>if you touch you,</i>
<br> you will <i>lose and the game will restart.</i>and the <i>points will not be count.</i>

<h2><b>Snake game v1.1</b></h2>

In Snake game v1.1, you can't go anywhere. That means you <i>can't go through the edge to other side.</i>
<br>if you <i>touch the edge you will lose.</i>but <i>points will be counted.</i>Remember this is very hard.

Enjoy playing! Bye! Bye!👋🏻👋🏻
